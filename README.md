# Pooch Memory Match

## Overview

> Pooch Memory match is a game with 18 cards face down and the player has to try and match all 9 pairs of matching cards by remembering the position of the cards.
Once the player has matched 2 cards they will be displayed face up until all pairs have been matched. Once all pairs have been matched the user will be
displayed a message that they have won the game. As the user clicks through the cards, stats will be kept letting the user know how many attempts they've made and the
accuracy of their choices.
