                  <h2>About the Pooch Memory Match Game</h2>
                  <p class="description">Pooch Memory Match is a game in which a player is faced with 18 cards, all with their backs showing.  None of the cards are unique, in fact each one of the faces of the cards have matches.   So really there are only 9 card faces since they each have a match.  The player must click on a card, the card will show its face and the player must click on another card in an effort to match the first card.  If the second card that the player clicked on is a match, then the cards remain showing and the player can try for the next matched pair.  If the second card was not a match, then both cards will flip over and show their backs.  In order to win the game, all cards must be matched.
